// The Fairy Shoe — pose edits: bones of the discipline scene's poses that are set by hand rather than by the engine's pose tables.
// One list per position; an entry names whose pose it is (who: 'subject' or 'giver' — the player), at which beat (the subject's 'base'
// resting pose and what it blends toward when struck, 'contact'; the player's 'relaxed', 'raised' and 'contact'), and the bones it sets, as
// local Euler angles in degrees [x, y, z] (order YXZ, the pose tables' convention). The character editor prints a report in exactly this
// form (Pose editor ▸ Report, then the Report section): paste its entries here. Nothing else writes to this file.
